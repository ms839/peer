        <h1>Peer mediation</h1>
<p> Peer mediation is about helping others and solving their problem. Two peer mediators sit in a circle with both of the people who have a conflict, and each person has a time to talk about their side of the story. 
Make an appointment if you ever have some beef between someone. It's better to solve a p          roblem without violence. Makes life easier for you and everyone around you. Click on this email to set an appointment, Oliver and the peer mediators would love to help. Educators who have implemented peer mediation programs attribute many benefits to them. Hundreds of educators, separated by many miles and vastly different circumstances, report similar experiences. Although it is essential to be cautious because most of these claims are unsubstantiated and based on anecdotal evidence, it is likely that peer mediation programs have some degree of positive impact on all of the areas listed below.

<li> <strong>Peer Mediation is Preventive:</strong>Peer mediation is not only used after a conflict has erupted into violence, it works in numerous ways to effectively prevent violent conflict. The development of conflict resolution skills in both mediators and the students-at-large enables them to resolve more of their own conflicts. Outreach efforts encourage students to come to mediation soon after conflicts develop and before they escalate. Even after a conflict has erupted, mediation can prevent it from leading to more or greater conflicts. Most large-group disputes can be prevented if the interpersonal conflicts at their core are resolved in a timely manner. Peer mediation can also can be a boon to other prevention efforts. Many of the factors that contribute to problems like substance abuse and teen pregnancy (low self-esteem, lack of decision-making skills, negative peer pressure) seem to be positively effected by peer mediation programs.
